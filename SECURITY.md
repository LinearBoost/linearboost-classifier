# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think you found a vulnerability, and even if you are not sure about it, please report it right away by sending an email to: `hamid9 at outlook dot com`. Please try to be as explicit as possible, describing all the steps and example code to reproduce the security issue.

## Vulnerability Disclosures

Critical vulnerabilities will be disclosed via GitHub's [security advisory](https://github.com/LinearBoost/linearboost-classifier/security) system.

## Public Discussions

Please restrain from publicly discussing a potential security vulnerability.

It's better to discuss privately and try to find a solution first, to limit the potential impact as much as possible.
