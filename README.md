LinearBoost Classifier
=======================

LinearBoost is a classification algorithm that is designed to boost a linear classifier algorithm named SEFR. It is an efficient classification algorithm that can result in state-of-the-art accuracy and F1 score. It has the following advantages:

- Fast training speed
- Low memory requirement
- Good accuracy
